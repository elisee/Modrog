## Building

You'll need .NET Core 3 and Visual Studio 2019. VS Code might work.

## Running

 * You can use `RunServer.bat` or `RunClient.bat` to start one and then you can debug the other from VS.
 * `RunServer.bat new` will overwrite the generated map.

## TODO

    (x) Text editor
      (x) Scrolling
      ( ) Allow moving text cursor with mouse
      ( ) Selection / Copy / Paste
    ( ) Display script errors somewhere
    ( ) Increase script window size?
    ( ) Replace ugly single font with some of Chevy Ray's pixel fonts probably
    ( ) Support renaming scripts
    ( ) If a move enters a chunk that was marked as free, mark it as used to prevent spawning people in it (or we need to try entities by chunk and check for that)
    ( ) Make server generate and control enemies, support combat
    ( ) The factory has a limited amount of crystals and dies if it's not filled up
    ( ) Goal : Find people in your team and link your cores with wires or something
    ( ) Server sends list of connected core networks by team (red vs blue)
    ( ) Generate Rocks!
    ( ) Add UI for connecting to a server and report errors rather than just crashing
