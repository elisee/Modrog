# DeepSwarm

## Building

You'll need .NET Core 3 and Visual Studio 2019. VS Code might work.

## Running

 * You can use `RunServer.bat` or `RunClient.bat` to start one and then you can debug the other from VS.
 * `RunServer.bat new` will overwrite the generated map.

## TODO

    ( ) Need to figure out ASAP what the actual gameplay loop is. Factorio-style? Northgard? Something else?
    ( ) UI: Allow moving TextInput / TextEditor text cursor with mouse
    ( ) UI: Selection / Copy / Paste in TextInput / TextEditor
    ( ) UI: Display script errors somewhere
    ( ) UI: Increase script window size?
    ( ) UI: Support resizable window (requires better AnchorRectangle system)
    ( ) UI: Replace ugly single font with some of Chevy Ray's pixel fonts probably
    ( ) Scripting: Support renaming scripts
    ( ) Server: Mark chunk as non-free if an entity enters it to prevent spawning people in it (or we need to track entities by chunk and check for that)
    ( ) Server: Generate and control enemies
    ( ) Implement Attack move
    ( ) Design & implement more unit types: one that can fire from a distance but has less health, one that digs faster, etc.
    ( ) Design & implement more building types: turrets, refinery, etc.
    ( ) Server sends list of connected core networks by team (red vs blue)? If we go that route
    ( ) Add UI for connecting to a server and report errors rather than just crashing
